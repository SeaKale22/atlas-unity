Technical Description

This project focuses on the following areas:

    Understanding AR Fundamentals: Learn about ARKit, ARCore, ARFoundation, plane detection, and how to detect planes using AR Foundation.
    Designing AR Applications: Understand how to create responsive UI for mobile devices, design in an augmented reality space, and publish applications for both Android and iOS with Unity’s AR Foundation.
    AR Game Mechanics: Implement a game that allows interaction between a screen and the user’s physical space, creating moving targets on detected horizontal planes, launching projectiles to hit these targets.

To develop this project, you will be using Unity’s AR Foundation and Unity 2022 LTS, and install both the ARKit XR Unity plugin and the ARCore XR Unity plugin for both iOS and Android builds. It’s worth noting that if you are using Unity 2020 LTS, you might need to build for Android with a different version of Gradle.

You’re strongly encouraged to read through all tasks before starting the project. Doing so will help you understand the entire flow of the application, aiding your development process immensely.
